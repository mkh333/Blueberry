# 🫐 Blueberry Yield Regression

This project focuses on building a regression model to predict blueberry crop yields using data collected from farms. The task is to estimate the yield per acre based on various agricultural and environmental features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset contains information about:
- Soil quality
- Weather conditions
- Farm management practices
- Biological indicators

The goal is to apply machine learning models to predict yield_per_acre.
